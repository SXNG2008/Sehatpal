# Sehatpal
SehatPal: A dual-mode healthcare ecosystem featuring a QR-based emergency system to eliminate medical information lag during the Golden Hour.

* **Smart Booking:** Real-time doctor availability and one-tap scheduling.
* **Hospital Connectivity:** Direct report uploads from labs to patient profiles.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Tailwind-inspired), JavaScript
* **Security:** Planned AES-256 Encryption for medical data
* **Deployment:** Vercel

## 📁 Project Structure
* `index.html` - Landing page with mode selection.
* `emergency_scan.html` - Interface for responders to scan QR.
